# EDA--Roller-Coaster
Exploratory Data Analysis - Pandas and Matplotlib
Pandas EDA on a Kaggle Dataset
I recently decided to brush up on my Pandas skills and ended up doing a quick Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a simple Kaggle dataset. This project allowed me to dive into data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python. I hope you find it interesting and maybe even a little inspiring for your own projects!

Overview
Project: Quick EDA using Pandas
Dataset: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashmikrishnamohan/roller-coaster-dataset)
Goal: To refresh my Pandas skills while exploring interesting trends and insights hidden within the data.
What's Inside
notebook.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis.
Visualizations: Various plots and charts that highlight key findings from the data.
Key Insights
Some of the interesting insights from my analysis include:

Data Trends: A look into how certain Year_introduced, Speed, Height, Gforce and Inversion vary and relate to each other.
Correlation: Identification of Correlation between variables in the dataset.
Data Cleaning: Techniques for handling missing values and cleaning the data.
